<u>Key Features of RNN:</u>

- One of the oldest neural network architectures, developed in the 1980s.
- Recently became popular due to the availability of large datasets and increased computational power.
- Primarily used for **sequence** and **time series data**.
- RNNs have internal memory, allowing them to store information from previous steps in the sequence.
- The internal memory helps the network make predictions based on historical data.
- RNNs are **feedback neural networks**, with self-loops at the hidden layer.
